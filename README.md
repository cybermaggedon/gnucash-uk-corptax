# `gnucash-uk-corptax`

## Introduction

This is a utility which takes a UK corporation tax return formatted using
[`gnucash-ixbrl`](https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-ixbrl) and
submits in accordance with the HMRC Corporation Tax filing API.

`gnucash-uk-corptax` presently understands a small subset of the corporation
tax submission.  It might be useful for a small business with simple tax
affairs.  It really is no use to a complex business.

## Status

This is a command-line utility, which has been tested with the HMRC test API.

## Credentials

In order to use this, you need production credentials (vendor ID, username,
password) for the Corporation Tax API.  HMRC does not permit these
credentials to be shared publicly.

Developer hub: 
https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub

## Installing

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-uk-corptax
```

## Testing

There is a corptax emulator here.  Run:

```
corptax-test-service
```

To submit the test account data to the test service:

```
gnucash-uk-corptax -c config.json -a accts.html -t ct600.html --submit
```

Output should look like this:
```
IRmark is hOgMwO+75eJbBax/OhPZy/NszxE=
Correlation ID is 1E242
Endpoint is http://localhost:8082/
Poll time is 1.0

The two files `accts.html` and `ct600.html` included in this repo
are sample accounts which were output from `gnucash-ixbrl`.

The configuration file is a JSON file, should look something like this:

```
{
    "company-type": 6,
    "declaration-name": "Sarah McAcre",
    "declaration-status": "Director",
    "username": "CTUser100",
    "password": "password",
    "gateway-test": "1",
    "tax-reference": "1234123412",
    "vendor-id": "1234",
    "software": "gnucash-uk-corptax",
    "software-version": "0.0.1",
    "url": "http://localhost:8081/",
    "title": "Ms",
    "first-name": "Sarah",
    "second-name": "McAcre",
    "email": "sarah@example.org",
    "phone": "447900123456"
}
```

The accounts file is an iXBRL-formatted company accounts file.  The
computations file is an iXBRL-formatted corporation tax computations.

Corporation tax data is read from the corporation tax computations, and
used to construct the GovTalkMessage containing corporation tax submission
and account information.  This is submitted to the corporation tax
endpoint.
